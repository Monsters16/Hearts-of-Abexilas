 myrtana_story_events.1.t:0 "Long day in Theos."
 myrtana_story_events.1.d:0 "It was a late night in Theos, factories were almost closing, the civilians go home in a bit, but something unusual happened today at the weapon factory in Theos. At the rifle craftsmanship sector, one of the workers called Luxvie has been walking around paranoid for hours, not knowing why the other worker called Stella has came up to her and asked her: \n\n"Luxvie, what's happening with ya?! Are you alright?!".\n\nLuxvie responded with: "I can't do this... I just can't..."\n\nStella confused asked, "Wait what are you talking about?"\n\nLuxvie said, "Soon, my family and I will help the others to liberate us from this tyrant..."\n\nStella, being Loyalist to the King Ravian, shocked said: "Well, wait when are you guys gonna help them?"\n\nLuxvie said: "Don't tell anyone but, we are going tommorow right in the morning to Torsheim."\n\n"Understandable, good luck." Were last words Stella said to her before she went away, the shift ended and everyone went home.\n\nUntil tommorow on National News of Theos, it has been reported that Luxvie and her family have been found dead in their apartment. The authorities said they aren't sure what caused it, but the medical experts say it was a murder with some short of really sharp object, being stabbed into each member multiple times. \n\nThe investigation is currently ongoing."
 myrtana_story_events.1.a:0 "Guess you cannot trust anyone these days huh...?"
 myrtana_story_events.2.t:0 "Routine Checkup."
 myrtana_story_events.2.d:0 "After the long day of constant training troops and drinking, the generals of Myrtanian Millitary: LaziOcelot, Pr1x and Bogdan have all gathered due to being called in to meeting by the King himself. They've sat down each with a bottle of beer while waiting for King to arrive, however that was not the case. Suddenly someone opened the door and it turned out to be Jim, Ravian's righthand man. Who came up to check on all millitary stuff, he checked through their history and decided to sit down with them. Lighting a cigarette before starting to bring out some papers. \n\n"Gentlemen, I've came here to discuss something important with all of you. Due to all unrest and the events happening in past few weeks. We are doing a regular check up from now on."\n\nLaziOcelot immediatly interrupted Jim and said: "Wait, there can be a spy here?"\n\nJimmon responded with: "Ocelot, first of all, let me finish. Secondly no, we are not sure 100%. But we did get a tip that someone might have inflitrated our ranks. A few collaborators as we call them."\n\nPr1x said: "Suprised a spy even managed to come here knowing how many people got supressed..."\n\nShortly after, Jim started to notice how Ocelot was sweating after Pr1x mentioned that. He looked at him deep in the eyes and saw that he was trying to hide something.\n\n"Ocelot, may I ask, why are you feeling so anxious?"\n\nOcelot responded with "What are you talking about?"\n\nJim knew that there were guards outside waiting ready to take out any spy, and he took a brief second to look at Ocelot. Since he knew he had to get rid of ANY enemy spies as soon as possible he's got two choices. Either let Ocelot go, or shout for guards to arrest him."
 myrtana_story_events.2.a:0 "Knock Ocelot out on spot and execute him."
 myrtana_story_events.2.b:0 "Maybe he is just having a hard night, something might have been in that drink."
 myrtana_pre_civil.1.t:0 "Unrest in Torsheim!"
 myrtana_pre_civil.1.d:0 "In the past few weeks Torsheim became very dangerous place, the people were protesting for independence and it seemed like there was no end to it in sight. However, there were also some of our local diplomats supporting the protestors like Aegis, who is believed to be the main one behind organizing the mass protest.\n\nWe can either send in the police to restore peace, which we can't know if it will put them down or just make it worse. This could also result in even worse position for us as it would show us in a really bad spotlight. Or we could try to compromise with the protestors, which could probably be the best choice after all.\n\nHowever there is one other option presented by our general staff, that is to execute the perpetrator himself. This could severely weaken the movement but it could also increase it. \n\nWhat should we do?"
 myrtana_pre_civil.1.a:0 "Send in the Police! We must get rid of any seperatist ideas!"
 myrtana_pre_civil.1.b:0 "Violence never solved anything. We should make an arrangement with them."
 myrtana_pre_civil.1.c:0 "We gotta aim for the source. Call an assasin on Aegis."
 myrtana_pre_civil.2.t:0 "The Myrtanian Defense Force has landed in Torsheim!"
 myrtana_pre_civil.2.d:0 "Yesterday at 6:30 AM, General LaziOcelot has landed along with 15+ soliders to declare police authority over the city, the protestors still continued to resist and it led eventually to a full on fight between The Myrtanian Police Force and Protestors who seemed like they were growing in size each day.\n\nNow it is only a matter of luck who will win. LaziOcelot and his men, or the protestors will exhaust the police."
 myrtana_pre_civil.2.a:0 "Ocelot and his Police unit manage to supress the Protestors"
 myrtana_pre_civil.2.b:0 "The Protestors exhaust the Police, and make them retreat back to Theos."
 myrtana_pre_civil.3.t:0 "Compromise with the Protestors"
 myrtana_pre_civil.3.d:0 "At 8:00 AM today, the leader of Myrtana, Ravian the 1st Procol Rune has met with Aegis and the rest of protestors today to sign a compromise.\n\nThey went inside the Torsheim's Fort and officaly, with a lot of medias around signed a document that will be known as "Treaty of Torsheim". In which the said city will be given to be independent country, however the two nations will maintain good relations, along with signing a Non-Aggresion Pact to preserve peace.\n\nThis treaty should now allow both nations to develop friendly relations, along with them both hopefully reaching prosperity together."
 myrtana_pre_civil.3.a:0 "This treaty will mark history!"
 myrtana_pre_civil.4.t:0 "Assasination Sucess!"
 myrtana_pre_civil.4.d:0 "We managed to send in the spy to inflitrate protestor's city with a sniper rifle and we got report that Aegis was assasinated from getting shot in the back of his head."
 myrtana_pre_civil.4.a:0 "That should do the trick."
