 HRP_parliamentary_overhaul:0 "Parliamentary Overhaul"
 HRP_parliamentary_overhaul_desc:0 "For years now, Parliament sessions have been held in the Church of Saint Arika, a Makerist church built by Joshua Josephson. This has worked, but... it is time we finally upgrade to a dedicated, secular building for this."

 HRP_fertilizer_farms_desc:0 "Much of Harpia's farmland is used for subsistence farming, and some light commercial agriculture. By setting aside land to grow crops that will become fertilizer, we can drastically improve crop yields."

 HRP_put_the_smart_fellas_to_work_desc:0 "There are many bright minds in Harpia that would be much better at developing new ways to farm, fuel, and industrialize than at any other job-like underwater basket weaving. Let's sponsor their developments!"
 HRP_allow_unionization:0 "Allow Unionization"
 HRP_allow_unionization_desc:0 "While in many ways somewhat antithetical to the capitalist and libertarian views of our founder, unions are an unavoidable part of modern industry. By letting them exist in one way or another, we can prevent workers from getting uppity."
 HRP_improve_ease_of_access:0 "Improve Ease of Access"
 HRP_improve_ease_of_access_desc:0 "Due to Neo Baldia being built underwater, getting into and around the area is... difficult, to say the least. By making it easier to get in and around, more tourists will show up!"

 HRP_diversify_our_industry_desc:0 "Cacti has dominated the economy of Kuára-Alasti for too long! By branching out into clay, nether wart, and armor production, we can keep our back pockets full should the price of XP crash."
 HRP_residential_subsidies:0 "Residential Subsidies"
 HRP_residential_subsidies_desc:0 "Perhaps the biggest issue in Neo Baldia is how low the population is. By offering subsidies to immigrants and the poor to move there, they will make us back the money we spend housing them, and then some!"

 HRP_lend_dock_builders_to_the_cities_desc:0 "While there is much money to be made in being the only city building ships at any reasonable rate, it traps our economy and gives us no competition.

 HRP_establish_national_forestry_reserves_desc:0 "There is always a chance we will utterly obliterate our wood supply, sadly. Should this happen, our nation would collapse. Therefore, it is essential we create reserves of woodlands that we maintain carefully, should the need for more lumber arise."
 HRP_mandate_two_story_houses:0 "Mandate Two Story Houses"
 HRP_mandate_two_story_houses_desc:0 "A house with only a single story can house maybe one family, thus limiting the usage of the floorspace. By making sure every home has two or more stories, we can fit more people within the city."

 HRP_build_a_church_for_rachieism_desc:0 "Rachie is the name of a politician, a city, and a religion. However, only two of these have any real influence on the national stage. It is time to let our religion spread!"

 HRP_form_the_harpian_police_division_desc:0 "The National Militia is an organization meant to be called up only for the immediate defense of the Republic.

 HRP_give_the_militia_to_the_cities_desc:0 "The National Militia is only to be used in the defense of the Republic. This, however, makes it large, expensive, and useless for most things. By giving control of the Militia to the cities of the Republic, we can keep our people safe."
 HRP_establish_the_river_patrol_company:0 "Establish The River Patrol Company"
 HRP_establish_the_river_patrol_company_desc:0 "The Iron River splits our nation in two, and with only two ways across, there's bound to be issues going on along the river.

 HRP_the_gunboat_program:0 "The Gunboat Program"
 HRP_the_gunboat_program_desc:0 "Each and every city in Harpia has access to the sea, and there is no reason that these cities shouldn't use this for their benefit! Just as each city has a small militia, so too will it have a small navy to call on during times of crisis."

 HRP_merge_the_marines_into_the_republican_guard_desc:0 "The Republican Marines and Republican Guard serve the same purpose, basically. This is a bad idea, because we're wasting time and energy! By merging them into a new Republican Guard, we can make our army far better!"

 HRP_hirerozzakkoranmilitaryinstructors_desc:0 "Harpia, aside from some small skirmishes with some bandits years ago, has never been to war. By hiring soldiers and generals from recent wars, our soldiers will learn exactly how to fight out in the real world."
 HRP_build_a_highship_port:0 "Build a Highship Port"
 HRP_build_a_highship_port_desc:0 "Highships, like regular ships, need a place to be repaired, refueled, and rearmed. By building the New Moonburg Highship Port, we can actually keep these ships usable."
 HRP_starting_small:0 "Starting Small"
 HRP_starting_small_desc:0 "We have very little experience with highship technology, and might do something bad. So by starting with very small highships driven by one man and armed with some small weapons, we can test a whole new form of warfare."

 HRP_build_a_flagship_desc:0 "There are many types of ships that we have built, all of which serve different purposes. However, the role of the Flagship must be filled by a brand new warship, able to level any other."

 HRP_the_noncombat_roles_desc:0 "For every soldier fighting on the frontlines, there are many more behind the lines.

 HRP_improve_fuel_efficiency:0 "Improve Fuel Efficiency"

 HRP_infantryleadstheway_desc:0 "The humble infantryman. Boots on the ground, weapon in hand, told to take that hill, defend that fort, or ambush those forces, alongside a dozen and a half other roles. Infantry is seen as thankless. No more!

 HRP_harpian_grenadier_corps:0 "Harpian Grenadier Corps"
 HRP_harpian_grenadier_corps_desc:0 "The Republican Guard has no shortage of eager infantrymen who want to serve their country.

 HRP_multirole_fighters:0 "Multirole Fighters"
 HRP_multirole_fighters_desc:0 "As it would seem, these small highships-which our soldiers are calling Zippys due to how they zip through the sky-are quite useful for warfare. Close air support, bombing, and scouting are all easy for a Zippy. We need to make WAY more of these!"

 HRP_focus_on_small_ships_desc:0 "Harpia is a small nation, with a small population and a small industry. We cannot be expected to make a navy strong enough to destroy everything. We need to focus on making smaller ships to raid the enemy, and retreat before they can recover."
 HRP_a_grand_navy:0 "A Grand Navy"
 HRP_a_grand_navy_desc:0 "There is no reason Harpia should not be able to smash any foe in naval combat! The strongest cruisers, the most imposing battleships, and even new Highship Carriers will give us domination on the seas."

 HRP_just_blow_them_up:0 "Just Blow Them Up"
 HRP_just_blow_them_up_desc:0 "Many people claim warfare is complex. This is trying to overcomplicate a simple issue. The enemy cannot fight if they are dead. And by making sure every soldier is armed with the finest weapons, we can blow up a lot of bad guys."
 HRP_pirates_of_the_1st_century:0 "Pirates of the 1st Century"
 HRP_pirates_of_the_1st_century_desc:0 "Piracy never pays-when done on a small scale. Only with state support can piracy succeed-in which case, it's privateering! The raiding fleet of Harpia will bring our foes to their knees!"
 HRP_obliteration_of_the_foe:0 "Obliteration of the Foe"
 HRP_obliteration_of_the_foe_desc:0 "Naval battles are usually won by forcing the enemy to retreat. This is stupid. Only when our enemies lay at the bottom of the sea can we consider a battle won!"

 HRP_flying_cities_of_annihilation:0 "Flying Cities of Annihilation"
 HRP_flying_cities_of_annihilation_desc:0 "To put it simply: we figured out how to make battleships fly. So, of course, knowing that the enemy cannot really DO anything about this, we're gonna exploit it."

 HRP_let_real_horses_rest:0 "Let Real Horses Rest"
 HRP_let_real_horses_rest_desc:0 "Horses have served us well as cavalry for a long while. However, it is time to let them retire. Fast tanks will replace them, and become far better."

 HRP_harpia_rules_the_waves_desc:0 "Harpia has long had access to the sea. And the waves on it have long given Harpians fish and trade access. But only now Harpia has managed to turn the ocean into its weapon! The navy of Harpia is one of the finest in the world, and will be THE finest soon!"

 HRP_the_practical_air_corps_desc:0 "Large highships, much like battleships, are weapons of the past. The zippy is the way of the future, small, cheap, and absolutely devastating. By making our pilots exclusively go to zippys, we can rule the skies."

 HRP_theformationoftherozakkorandefensepact_desc:0 "Democratic states, and those that share our principles, regardless of how they express them, need to band together. Rozakko'ra holds a great many of these states, so of course we must create a brand new defense pact!"
