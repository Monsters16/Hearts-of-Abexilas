 POLITICS_KLYMON_DESC:0 "Born: Unknown\n\nDescription: Born in an unknown universe in an unknown time period, Klymön hails from a world in which winter had set in but never left. Leading to a frozen world with 87% of all life dying on the surface. Before the freeze, Klymön was known through out his homeland as an Engineer who created revolutionary weaponry and machines for both war and farming purposes. While his weapons and machines would not lead to the never-ending winter, they would end up playing a part in it as the break of war caused the planet to eventually fall into the winter. Klymön had grown tired and stressed with the Rathnirian world, desiring to flee to a more peaceful realm not explored yet by people like himself. Klymön worked day and night until he was finally able to use his powers to form a portal, which instantly and rapidly sucked himself in and through. Passing through the portal, Klymön landed with a thud into the thick and cold spruce woods of what is now known as Cofdo. From there, Klymön began walking and settled in the land of Erterde, working and building up the settlement for the native Saytrs whom grew to enjoy his company."

At the age of 18, he began military training and was baptized into the Makerist Faith, one of the religions that survived the destruction of Rathnir.\n\nAt 22, Josephson created the Soldier's Progressive and Makerist Party of Harpia (SPMPH), and it managed to win the controversial elections of 17 VE, and formed a minority government meant to last only until the next elections, in which he will step down. Given command of the ship of state for only one term, Josephson has done what he can to keep the nation stable, but given that time is running out, only time will tell what becomes of the nation he so loves."
