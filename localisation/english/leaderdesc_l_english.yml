Leading to a frozen world with 87% of all life dying on the surface. Before the freeze, Klymön was known through out his homeland as an Engineer who created revolutionary weaponry and machines for both war and farming purposes. While his weapons and machines would not lead to the never-ending winter, they would end up playing a part in it as the break of war caused the planet to eventually fall into the winter. Klymön had grown tired and stressed with the Rathnirian world, desiring to flee to a more peaceful realm not explored yet by people like himself. Klymön worked day and night until he was finally able to use his powers to form a portal, which instantly and rapidly sucked himself in and through. Passing through the portal, Klymön landed with a thud into the thick and cold spruce woods of what is now known as Cofdo. From there, Klymön began walking and settled in the land of Erterde, working and building up the settlement for the native Saytrs whom grew to enjoy his company."
