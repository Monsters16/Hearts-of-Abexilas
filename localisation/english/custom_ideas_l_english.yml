While it's continued existence has not been wholly conventional, Gardenia's origins in Eldham's middle period and persistence of its existence distinguishes itself among the many nations of Cathelet. On Eldham, Gardenia began through its two predecessor states: the Mercantile Republic of Velenu established itself through the bloodless December Schism against the Technocracy of Aquatos, slowly managing to carve its way across the Urakiend islands. At the same time the territories that would become Nyr Villhorn saw the establishment of the Rosthorn Family, of which Venipher Velaran, then Venipher Rosthorn, was a prominent member of. Through these two states, Gardenia found itself split between Phoros to its south, but more importantly, the Drakaesland to its north, of which the nation would have a long history with.While Velenu had a long history with the states of the Drakaesland, being a member of the League of Vircon, Gardenia through its cultural revolution saw the seeping of Drakaen values and ideals into its manner of government, language, and its people. In the end, Gardenia believed in upholding the ideals of a multicultural and multiethnic society bound together by Drakaen nationalism and the goodwill of its Empress. But with no dragon to turn to, Gardenia itself took up the mantel of the successor of the Drakaesland, and the goal of spreading its own unique blend of Gardenian-Drakaen idealism."
